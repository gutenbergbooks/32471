<h2>THE PREFACE</h2>

<p>Art supervisors in the public schools assign picture-study
work in each grade, recommending the study of certain pictures
by well-known masters. As Supervisor of Drawing I found
that the children enjoyed this work but that the teachers felt
incompetent to conduct the lessons as they lacked time to
look up the subject and to gather adequate material. Recourse
to a great many books was necessary and often while
much information could usually be found about the artist,
very little was available about his pictures.</p>

<p>Hence I began collecting information about the pictures
and preparing the lessons for the teachers just as I would
give them myself to pupils of their grade.</p>

<p>My plan does not include many pictures during the year,
as this is to be only a part of the art work and is not intended
to take the place of drawing.</p>

<p>The lessons in this grade are planned for the usual drawing
period of from twenty to thirty minutes, and have been given
in that time successfully.</p>

<p><b>Questions to arouse interest.</b> What do
you see in this picture? What are the children
doing? Where do they live? On what are
they sitting? Whom can you see behind the
house? What is he doing? What do you
think the children were doing before their
mother called them? why? What does the hen
expect? What else do you see in the picture?
What time of day do you think it is? Why is
this picture called "Feeding Her Birds"? How
many like it? why?</p>


<p><b>The story of the picture.</b> In a tiny white
cottage in a little village in France, lived a
painter with his wife and nine children. This
painter's name was Jean François Millet, and
although quite poor his was a very happy
family. Nearly every morning the father
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
worked hard in his garden behind the house,
and every afternoon in a queer little old room
he called his studio. Here he painted beautiful
pictures of places and people he saw and loved.
Almost all of his pictures are of the country
and of people who worked, because he knew
most about them and because he loved them
best.</p>

<p>Sometimes he finished his work in the garden
very early, and then he was glad, for he liked
better to paint than to do anything else in the
world.</p>

<p>One day when he looked out through the
window of his studio he saw a much prettier
picture than the one he was painting. He saw
three of his children sitting in a row on the
doorstep, while the mother fed broth to each of
them in turn from a wooden spoon. As they
crowded close together they reminded him of
some little birds he had been watching that
morning. You know how little birds open their
bills and crowd toward the edge of the nest
when the mother bird feeds them? Millet
thought he would paint this picture, and name
it "Feeding Her Birds."</p>

<p>See how the mother tips forward on the
stool as she bends toward the three children.
That is a wooden spoon she holds in her hand,
and it is full of hot broth from the bowl in her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
lap. The children seem to be very hungry.
No doubt they have been playing hard all the
morning.</p>

<p>It is easy to see with what the little girl
at the left-hand side of the picture has been
playing. She holds her wooden doll very close,
and loves it just as much as if it were china
and had real hair as your own doll has. She is
the eldest of the children, and you can see she
is unselfish because she sits patiently by while
her baby brother and little sister get the first
taste of the delicious broth.</p>

<p>The boy and the younger girl must have
been playing with the basket and cart you see
in the picture, for the basket is overturned as
if it had been dropped in a hurry when the
mother came to the door with the broth. Now
the playthings are quite forgotten.</p>

<p>The boy opens his mouth wide as he leans
forward for the first taste, while the little sister
puts her arm around him to hold him steady.
As she watches him, she opens her mouth, too.</p>

<p>See the hen running toward them! She
thinks there will surely be something for her to
eat, too.</p>

<p>The three children wear long aprons all
alike, and the queer wooden shoes that the
peasants always wore in those days. What a
clatter those wooden shoes must have made
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
even when the children played in the yard!
And what a noise they made on the wooden
floors in the house unless the children walked
very carefully!</p>

<p>The girls wear bonnets tied with string,
while the boy has a cap that looks very much
like a tam-o'-shanter, except that it, too, is tied
under his chin. The mother wears a handkerchief
on her head and another round her neck.
Her dress looks thick and warm, and so do the
children's dresses. It must be a cool day, for
even the doll is wrapped in a shawl.</p>

<p>The man behind the house is working busily
in the garden. Millet must have thought of
himself when he painted this man, for, like the
father bird, he must work hard to get enough
food for his family. Sometimes there was very
little, and the bread had to be divided into such
tiny pieces that the children were still hungry
when they had eaten their share.</p>

<p>We know it must be about noon because the
shadows in the picture are so short. What a
nice big yard these children had to play in, and
what good times they must have had playing
all kinds of games! They had lived in the city
of Paris several years and for that reason, no
doubt, they liked to play "keeping store" best
of all. They gathered acorns, stones, and
flowers, and placed them on a big wooden box
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
for a counter. Then they took turns being
storekeeper.</p>

<p>Perhaps to-day it had been the boy's turn,
and he had stood behind the counter ready to
sell his goods. The younger girl had come first,
carrying a basket. Probably they called the
stones oranges or apples, and, judging by the
overturned basket, the little girl must have
bought at least a dozen. Next had come the
little mother, with her doll baby riding in the
cart. This cart is hardly large enough for the
doll and so it had to be guided very carefully
to keep dolly from falling out.</p>

<p>When the mother called, the elder of the
two girls had caught up her doll quickly, leaving
the cart behind; the younger sister had
tossed her basket of oranges away in glee, while
the boy forgot all about his store at the thought
of the hot broth they were to have.</p>

<p>The high doorway of this little one-story,
whitewashed house of plaster and stones is
just wide enough for the three children to sit
one beside the other. That great vine growing
up beside the door is probably an ivy vine, for
we are told that the little white cottage is still
standing and is completely covered with ivy.</p>

<p>Everything you see in the picture is home-made,&mdash;the
clothes, the doll, the spoon, the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
cart, the basket, and even the milking stool
upon which the mother is seated.</p>

<p>Sitting there in the bright sunlight, these
round-faced, happy little children will soon
finish their broth; then they will be ready to
begin the "store-keeping" game again.</p>


<p><b>Questions to help the pupil understand the
picture.</b> In what country did these children
live? In what kind of house did they live?
What grew up beside the door? What did their
father do for a living? What was his name?
Where did he paint his pictures? What kind
of pictures did he like best to paint? why?
How did he happen to paint this picture?
Why did he call the picture "Feeding Her
Birds"? Upon what is the mother sitting?
What kind of a spoon has she in her hand?
What is in it, and in the bowl in her lap? What
makes you think the children are hungry?
Which one is fed first? Which one will probably
wait until the last? why? How are the children
dressed? What kind of shoes have they?
How many of you have ever seen wooden
shoes? How is the mother dressed? What
makes you think it must be a cool day? What
do the shadows tell us of the time of day?
What game did these children like to play?
What did they have to play with? Who made
their toys and clothes? What did they do
when their mother called them? What makes
you think they were happy children?</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
    <b>To the Teacher:</b> After the story is told,
the children should be allowed to act out the
picture. Stools or kindergarten chairs placed
in the schoolroom doorway, and a spoon, a doll,
a cart, and a basket, which the children will
gladly bring from home, are all the accessories
needed. It is well to let the pupils act out the
game which the children are supposed to have
been playing when the mother called them, as
well as the story in the picture itself.</p>


<p><b>The story of the artist.</b> Shall we tell you
something about the man, Millet, who painted
this picture?</p>

<p>Jean François Millet was the son of poor
French peasants. His father was a good man,
very fond of music and of all beautiful things
out of doors. Sometimes he would say to his
son, "Look at that tree, how large and beautiful
it is; as beautiful as a flower!" He would call
his son's attention to the fields, the sunsets, and
all things around him.</p>

<p>Millet's mother worked in the fields with his
father all day long. So it was his grandmother
who rocked him to sleep and cared for him
while he was very little. She was the one who
named him Jean after his father, and François
after the good St. Francis. She was a religious
woman, and almost the only pictures Millet saw
when he was a boy were those in his grandmother's
Bible. He copied them many times,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
drawing them with white chalk on the stone
wall. This pleased the grandmother very much,
and she encouraged him all she could.</p>

<p>When he was eighteen years old Millet drew
his first great picture. This is how it happened.
As he was coming home from church he met an
old man with bent back leaning on a cane as he
walked slowly along. Something about the bent
figure made Millet want to draw a picture of
him. So, taking some charcoal from his pocket,
he drew the picture on a stone wall. The people
passing by knew at once who it was; they were
pleased and told Millet so. His father, too, was
delighted, for he himself had once wished to be
an artist. He decided that his son should become
what he had wished to be; so he sent him
to a good teacher.</p>

<p>Millet worked very hard, but for a long time
his pictures did not sell, and he was very poor.
After a while people saw what wonderful pictures
he could paint, and they were glad to let him
know how much they thought of him and of his
beautiful paintings.</p>


<p><b>Questions about the artist.</b> Who painted
this picture? What kind of a man was his
father? What did he tell his son about the
trees? What did Millet's mother do? Who
took care of Millet while his parents worked
in the fields? What kind of pictures did Millet
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
have to look at? What did he draw first?
Where did he draw? Who helped him? Tell
about the old man leaning on a cane. On what
did Millet draw his picture? Who saw it?
What did they say? What did his father say?
What did he wish his son to be? What did
Millet do then? What do people think of his
pictures now? How many of you like this
picture?</p>

<h2>CHILDREN OF CHARLES I</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><b>Original Picture:</b> Turin (t&#363;´´r&#301;n) Gallery, Turin, Italy.</p>
<p><b>Artist:</b> Sir Anthony Van Dyck (v&#259;n d&#299;k´´).</p>
<p><b>Birthplace:</b> Antwerp, Belgium.</p>
<p><b>Dates:</b> Born, 1599; died, 1641.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Questions to arouse interest.</b> What are
these three little children doing? Who are
they? Did you ever have your picture taken?
Where did you go to have it taken? Where
do you think these children are? Why did they
not go to a photographer as we do? Who, do
you suppose, brought them to the studio? How
are they dressed? How long do you suppose
these children had to stand to have their picture
painted? How did the photographer tell you
to stand? What is the baby holding in his
hands? What do you see on the rug in front
of the little girl? Why do you suppose the dog
sits so quietly near Prince Charles? Which
child should you like best to play with? Who
painted this picture? Do you like it? why?</p>


<p><b>The story of the picture.</b> Once there lived
a very beautiful queen and a very proud king.
They had three beautiful children, whom they
loved very dearly. They were very proud of
these children, and gave them everything they
could to make them happy.</p>

<p>The child standing so straight with his hand
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
on the dog's head is a boy, although he is dressed
much like a girl. His name is Prince Charles.
He had the finest little pony and cart you ever
did see. His sister, Mary, the little girl standing
beside him, had a very beautiful doll that could
do so many wonderful things that it really seemed
to be alive. The baby, Prince James, had such
a great number of toys they almost filled a large
room. There were several servants who brought
out the toys and put them away again, and who
had nothing else to do but wait upon these
children. The children had a fine large yard to
play in, too. It was so large that people called
it a park. The king had his gardener build a
seat up in one of the big oak trees, and there
the children could play all kinds of games.</p>

<p>It was great fun to climb up into this seat,
where they were just as high up as the birds.
On windy days the big tree would rock back
and forth just like a swing. One day they were
having a good time in the park when they were
told their mother wanted them. They were to
be dressed to go and have their pictures painted.</p>

<p>There were no cameras in those days, so
there was no photograph gallery to go to. But
instead, there was a great artist whose name
was Sir Anthony Van Dyck. He painted beautiful
pictures with oil paints. Prince Charles
had already had his picture painted so many
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
times he probably would not have cared to
go if it had not been for the boat ride he
knew he would have. You see, the king's
palace and Sir Anthony Van Dyck's house both
stood near the banks of the same river. Sir
Anthony had a private boat landing made just
for the king and queen and their children. The
king liked so much to watch Sir Anthony Van
Dyck paint that he used to visit him nearly
every day. He had several fine boats to take
him there.</p>

<p>It must have taken a long time before the
children were dressed and ready to go. "Baby
Stuart," as people loved to call little Prince
James, wore blue silk, trimmed with lace. His
brother wore rose-colored silk, with a large lace
collar and cuffs. I don't see how he could run
or even walk in such a long, heavy dress; do
you? It looks as if it were his very best dress.
Probably he had a shorter one to play in.</p>

<p>How strange it seems that both the boys
wear bonnets tied under their chins, while the
little girl does not. Perhaps they did not want
to spoil her pretty curls. Princess Mary's
dress is white satin, trimmed with lace. She
looks like a grown-up lady in that dress.
People said she looked just like her lovely
queen mother. No doubt her mother curled
her hair and put the string of pearl beads
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
around her neck. Probably the queen mother
also gave Baby Stuart the big red apple he
holds in his hands. He was only two years old,
and she thought he might get hungry or need
something to play with.</p>

<img src="images/p013a-illus.jpg" width="500" height="509" alt="King's children" title=""/>
<p class="caption2"><i>Children of Charles I</i></p>
</div>

<p>When at last they were all ready, the boats
were waiting for them. Several ladies went
with the queen, so it was quite a party. It was
a beautiful ride down the river to Sir Anthony
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Van Dyck's house. When at last the boats
came to the landing place, very likely Prince
Charles was the first to jump on shore.</p>

<p>The great Sir Anthony Van Dyck himself
came out to meet them. He was glad to have
three such lovely children to paint. He was
very fond of children and then, too, he always
liked to have a great many people about him.
When the party entered his studio,&mdash;the room
where Van Dyck painted,&mdash;they found many
people already there. The ladies wore beautiful
dresses and the men, too, were dressed in
velvets and silks, and carried shining swords.
Sir Anthony Van Dyck had a very large, fine
dog, and as soon as the dog saw the children
he came right up to them. He seemed to like
Prince Charles best, and sat beside him all the
time his picture was being painted. He liked
to feel the soft stroke of Prince Charles's kind
hand.</p>

<p>Baby Stuart stands upon a raised platform
and his head is almost as high as his sister's.
He looks a little shy as he stands there, holding
his apple tight in his chubby little hands. His
sister Mary must have held some roses in her
hand and dropped them. Can you see them on
the rug, in front of her? If Baby Stuart should
drop his apple, perhaps the dog would bring
it to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
    Sir Anthony Van Dyck was very fond of
music, and always had some musicians playing
while he painted. The children liked the
music, too, and it made them forget they were
standing still so long. The ladies and gentlemen
talked together in another part of the room,
but this did not disturb the artist. He was so
absorbed in his work that he did not hear them,
and no one would have thought of interrupting
him.</p>

<p>The children stood still almost half an hour
that day before the artist said, "That will do";
and they came several times before Sir Anthony
Van Dyck could finish painting their faces.
Then he told their mother to send him the
three little dresses the children were wearing,
and he would paint them without the children.
You may be sure the children were glad they
did not need to stand while the dresses were
being painted.</p>

<p>Sir Anthony Van Dyck painted a curtain
just back of the children, and through the window
we see a rosebush which may be the one
from which the little Princess Mary picked her
roses. The great artist painted many pictures
of these three children, but the king and queen
liked this one best of all.</p>

<p>A long time after this picture was painted
the father, King Charles I, was beheaded by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
some of his people who did not like him. Prince
Charles grew up to be King Charles II. He did
not like to do anything but have a good time,
so people called him the "Merry Monarch."
He nearly always took a dog with him wherever
he went, even to church. He seemed to like a
certain very small dog best, and people named
these dogs after him. They called them "King
Charles spaniels." Have you ever seen a
King Charles spaniel?</p>

<p>When Princess Mary was only ten years
old she was married to the Prince of Orange,
who was then only fifteen years of age. But
she lived in her own home until she grew up.
When at last she did go to live in her husband's
country every one was glad to see her, for she
was such a good and wise princess. She often
helped her brothers, too, for it seemed as if
they were always in trouble.</p>

<p>Baby Stuart grew up to be a great naval
officer, who fought and won battles on a big
boat at sea. When his brother, King Charles II,
died, he became King James II.</p>

<p>When you look at this picture of Baby Stuart
you feel sure he will grow up to be a good king.
But, do you know, he was not a good king.
The people did not like him at all, and even
drove him out of the country. But we like to
think of him always as a pretty baby whose
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
queen mother used to sing him to sleep just as
other mothers do.</p>

<p>These three children liked to play and have
a good time just as much as we do. It would
be great fun to visit them and play with them,
would it not?</p>


<p><b>Questions to help the pupil understand the
picture.</b> Whose children are these? Where
did they live? Where did they play? Which
one is Prince Charles? Tell about him. When
he grew up what did he become? What kind
of a king was he? What kind of dogs were
named after him? why? How is he dressed
in this picture? Whose dog is he petting?
Who stands next to him? What color is
Princess Mary's dress? Whom did she look
like? Why do you suppose she does not wear
a cap or bonnet like her brothers? How is her
hair combed? How old was she when she
married the Prince of Orange? What kind of
a princess was she? Whom did she help?
Upon what is Baby Stuart standing? What
color is his dress? When he grew up, what did
he become? What kind of a king was he?
How old was he when this picture was painted?
Where was it painted? Who brought the
children to the studio? How did they bring
them? Who met them at the landing? What
kind of a place was this studio? How long did
the children stand? What helped to keep them
from getting tired? After Sir Anthony Van
Dyck had painted their faces, what did he say
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
about their dresses? What did the king and
queen think about this picture? What do
you think about it?</p>


<p><b>To the Teacher:</b> Allow the children to act
out the story. They will enjoy representing
the children at play in the park, getting dressed
for their picture, and finally posing for it.
Wrapping paper or even common newspapers
may be used to make the stiff, long skirts and
the caps. A make-believe boat is satisfactory.
A kindergarten stool will do for the platform
on which Baby Stuart is standing.</p>


<p><b>The story of the artist.</b> Sir Anthony Van
Dyck's father kept a silk store and sold beautiful
silks to rich people. He met so many fine folks
that he tried to be like them himself, and soon
had as fine manners as the best of them. This
made him just a little bit too proud, so that he
no longer cared to have anything to do with
any one who was common or poor.</p>

<p>The boy Anthony grew up with something of
the same feeling. When he was very little he
did not like to play with other boys, but preferred
to sit in his father's shop where the great
ladies came to buy silk. He liked to have them
smile at him, and to smile shyly back at them.</p>

<p>Anthony's mother made the most exquisite
embroidery and painted beautiful flowers. She
gave the little boy his first lessons in painting.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
By the time Anthony was old enough to go
to school his parents had become very rich, and
nothing was too good for their little boy. He
liked to draw better than anything else, and
so when he was fourteen years old they sent
him to a good teacher to learn how to draw and
paint. Here he worked very hard. He did
so well that in two years, when he wanted to
study with the great Dutch artist, Rubens, the
artist was glad to have him as his pupil.</p>

<p>There were a good many boys in the class.
One day their teacher, Rubens, went out for
a long walk. He always locked the door of
his private studio and no one else had a key,
except a servant. The boys wanted so much
to see what was in that room that they finally
persuaded the servant to let them in. Once
inside the studio, they crowded close around the
new picture Rubens was painting, and one of
the boys was pushed against it. His coat
sleeve rubbed off the chin and arm of the
Virgin the artist was painting. The boys were
terribly frightened, and did not know what to
do. Finally they decided that the chin and
arm must be painted in again. All said that
Anthony could do it better than any of the rest.</p>

<p>So well did he paint that even Rubens did
not know anything had happened. When he
did find out about it he was so pleased to know
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
that his pupil could paint so well he did not
scold the boys at all. After that he often let
Anthony help him paint his pictures.</p>

<p>Sir Anthony Van Dyck went on many long
journeys to see the work of other artists. He
had eleven brothers and sisters, for whom he
was always doing helpful things. He admired
beautiful silks, satins, velvets, and lace, and
liked best to paint people wearing fine clothes.
He did it so well, too, that all the people of
King Charles's court wanted him to paint their
portraits. He could always make them good
looking, for even if they had very ugly faces,
he painted such beautiful clothes on them that
they made lovely pictures.</p>

<p>He must have loved children, for all his
paintings of them look as if he did.</p>


<p><b>Questions about the artist.</b> Who painted
this picture? Tell about his mother and father.
What did Sir Anthony Van Dyck like to do
when he was a little boy? Who taught him to
draw? With what great artist did he study
when he was older? What happened to one of
Rubens's pictures? Who painted it over again?
Why did Rubens not scold him? What did Sir
Anthony Van Dyck like to paint best? What
makes you think he must have loved children?</p>

<h2>FOUR LITTLE SCAMPS<br />
ARE WE</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><b>Artist:</b> Julius Adam (&#259;d´´&#259;m).</p>
<p><b>Birthplace:</b> Unknown.</p>
<p><b>Dates:</b> Unknown.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Questions to arouse interest.</b> How many
of you like little kittens? How many have a
kitty at home? What are these little kittens
doing? Where do you think they are? What
makes you think they are all well fed and cared
for? What is the color of their fur? How
many of them look happy? How many have a
ribbon around the neck? What do you suppose
these little kittens have been doing? Which
one would you choose for your pet? why? Do
you think this is a good picture of kittens?
Why do you think so? Why do you suppose it
is called "Four Little Scamps Are We"?</p>


<p><b>The story of the picture.</b> Once there was
a man named Mr. Adam, who had four little
kittens just like these. He liked to watch them
play, and they loved him because he was so
kind to them. He must have found it very
hard to make them keep still long enough for
him to paint their pictures. Probably he put
them in a large glass cage with wire over the
top, as so many painters of cats have done.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
The wire was placed over the top so the kittens
could have plenty of air. Sometimes Mr. Adam
would drop a ball or string down through the
wire into the cage and play with the kittens.
The sides of the cage were made of glass so that
he could watch them while he painted, no matter
in what part of the cage they might be.</p>

<p>Perhaps these four little kittens have just
had a fine romp through the house. What do
you suppose they had for breakfast? Probably
a saucer full of milk, which is just what little
kittens like best.</p>

<p>Mr. Adam has finally succeeded in chasing
his four roguish little kittens into the cage.
They do not mind staying in the cage to please
him, for they like to have him talk to them and
play with them. They try to look their very
best for him, and wonder which one he will
take up first. Sometimes he must like to take
them up in his arms and pet them. Which one
would you like to take in your arms?</p>

<p>These four pretty kittens must be very
happy, for they look as if they were well cared
for. That first little kitten at the left-hand
side of the picture seems happy. We suspect
she is purring. That is the way she lets us
know she is happy, just as children sing when
they are happy. I am sure she would like to
lie in your lap and let you pet her. She holds
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
her head a little to one side, and her bright eyes
seem to say, "I may be little, but I'm spry.
Just roll a marble toward me, and see."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="p023a-illus" id="p023a-illus"></a>
<img src="images/p023a-illus.jpg" width="500" height="366" alt="Kittens" title=""/>
<p class="caption2"><i>Four Little Scamps Are We</i></p>
</div>

<p>How very wise the second little kitten looks!
Perhaps she is proud of her white collar and
cuffs. I am sure she keeps them nice and clean.
Such a baby she is, to be so thoughtful! But
she likes to play, too, no doubt. What do you
suppose she is thinking about? Maybe she is
thinking of a nice, soft red ball in a basket in
the sewing room, and after her picture is painted
perhaps she means to get that ball and surprise
the other kittens. Then they will all roll over
and over on the floor with it. Or maybe the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
mamma cat has told her she will show her how
to catch a mouse. She will need to keep very
quiet then, or the mouse will hear and run away.</p>

<p>The third little kitty is almost all white.
She looks as if she saw a bird. We hope she
is not such a naughty kitty as to try to catch
our pretty birds. I am sure Mr. Adam will not
want her to do that, and will teach her better.
But, do you know, I believe it is a fly she sees,
and I hope she will catch that. She surely
does look as if she were planning some mischief
as she crouches there ready for anything.</p>

<p>The last little kitten seems to say, "Oh, look
at my pretty ribbon! I am the only one of us
that wears a ribbon! Is it not fine?" No
wonder he holds his head so high! His fur is
striped, and he looks like a little tiger kitten.</p>

<p>With such bright eyes and such sharp ears
it is no wonder cats hear and see the little mice
that go about so quietly. Do you know why a
cat has whiskers? They say that the whiskers
are always as wide as the widest part of the
cat's body, so that when she wants to go through
a hole in the fence, or through any narrow place,
she can tell whether the opening is large enough.
If her whiskers just touch, she can go through
all right; but if they are pushed back, then it
is of no use for her to try, for there will not be
room enough to pass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
    Have you ever noticed the color of little
kittens' eyes? They are nearly always blue
when the kittens are very little, but turn yellow
as they grow older. Their eyes are very different
from ours, for they can see in the dark
as well as in the daytime.</p>

<p>What soft little cushions they have on their
feet! No wonder they can go about so quietly.
When they like you, they keep their claws hidden
in those cushions, and so they do not scratch
when they play with you.</p>

<p>Did you ever watch a cat sharpen her claws?
She usually sharpens them on the trunk of a
tree, but sometimes she likes to sharpen them
on the carpet or rug. Your mamma does not
like that. Even little kittens have very sharp
teeth and claws, and if you tease them, or they
are afraid, they bite and scratch. These little
kittens look as if they had never been teased or
felt cross, and we would not be a bit afraid to
pet them.</p>


<p><b>Questions to help the pupil understand the
picture.</b> Where do you suppose Mr. Adam put
these kittens when he wanted to paint them?
Why put them in a glass cage? Why have wire
over the top? Why do the kittens like to stay
in the cage? Which of the kittens has a ribbon
around the neck? How does he seem to feel?
What does the next kitten seem to be about
to do? What color is she? What is the next
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
little kitten doing? How does a kitten tell
us that she is happy? Why does a cat have
whiskers? How do a cat's eyes differ from ours?
What have cats on their feet that help them to
walk quietly? Of what use are their claws?
What does a cat do when she is angry? How
does she sharpen her claws? What does she
do with them if she likes you?</p>


<p><b>To the Teacher:</b> Allow the children to talk
freely of their kittens at home. Have them
draw a kitten with charcoal on manila paper.
Even if the results are not much in themselves,
their powers of observation will be quickened,
as is always shown when the same drawing is
attempted a few days later.</p>


<p><b>The story of the artist.</b> We know that Mr.
Adam must have been very fond of cats,
because he has painted so many pictures of
them; but that is all we really do know of him.
One authority gives the first letter of his name
as S., the dates of his birth and death as 1801
and 1867, and his birthplace, Italy. Another
authority gives the same dates but the initial
letter J. and the birthplace, France. The
paintings are signed T. or J. Adam, but no
record has been kept of the artist's life.</p>


<p><b>Questions about the artist.</b> Who painted
this picture? Why do you think he must have
liked cats?</p>

<p><b>Dates:</b> Born, 1483; died, 1520.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Questions to arouse interest.</b> Whom do you
see in this picture? Who is sitting in the chair?
Who leans against the mother's knee? What
is he holding under his arm? At whom is he
looking? Why do you think he loves the baby?
How many have a baby brother at home? What

<p><b>The story of the picture.</b> A long time ago a
good old man whose name was Bernardo lived
all alone in a little house in the woods. If
people were lost in the woods, or tired, or hungry,
they always came to him and he would
help them. It was his work to take care of the
trees and see that only the oldest and largest
were cut down. But there was one large oak
near his house he never would let the men cut.
Its branches kept his house cool in summer with
their shade, and in the winter they sheltered
it from the bitter cold winds. Bernardo, living
all alone and with no one to talk to, used to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
talk to the tree. And the big oak would nod
its branches as if it understood every word.</p>

<p>All the trees belonged to a man who used
the wood to make barrels. He made hundreds
and hundreds of barrels, and though it took a
great many trees to give him wood enough, he
always spared the oak tree. Sometimes when
this man came out to see about his trees his
little daughter Mary came with him. And so
Bernardo and little Mary became great friends.
In fact, the old man said he had only two
friends, the oak to whom he talked and little
Mary who talked to him.</p>

<p>One day there was a dreadful storm and
Bernardo's little house shook so in the wind that
he was afraid to stay in it. He looked at the
oak tree, and it seemed to motion to him and
tell him to come into its branches, where he
would be safe. So he put some bread in his
pocket, for he knew the storm would last a
long time, and climbed up into the tree. It
was a good thing he did so, too, for very soon
his house was blown down. Hundreds of
birds also hid among the branches of the big
tree during the storm, which lasted three days.</p>

<p>The old man wished he had brought more
bread to eat, for the ground was covered with
water so deep he did not dare leave the tree.
Just as he began to think he would starve,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Mary and her father came in search of him
and took him to their home. Little Mary had
been thinking of him all the time, and just as
soon as they could they had come for him. So
you see his two friends, Mary and the oak, had
saved his life, and Bernardo loved them more
than ever. He prayed that in some way his
two good friends might always be remembered
together.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">

<img src="images/p029a-illus.jpg" width="500" height="507" alt="Madonna" title=""/>
<p class="caption2"><i>Madonna of the Chair</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
    Many years after, Bernardo died. By that
time the oak was so old it seemed as if it would
fall over and break the other trees near it, or
maybe hurt somebody. So it was cut down,
and Mary's father had it made into fine new
barrels. By this time the little Mary had
grown up, was married, and had two fine boys
of her own. She was sitting out on the nice
big porch of her home one day, holding the baby
in her arms, when the older boy came running
to her to show her a stick which one of the
workmen had carved into a cross. And who
should happen to be passing the house at that
very moment but the great artist, Raphael.</p>

<p>When he looked up and saw the lovely mother
and her children, he thought he had never seen
anything so beautiful. He was on his way
home after a long walk, and did not even have
his paints with him. But he saw the empty
barrels in the yard, and choosing one with a
nice smooth head, he drew on it, with a piece of
charcoal, a picture of Mary and her children.
He took the drawing home with him and painted
this great picture. So the old man's wish came
true, for this barrel end made from the old oak
tree, with the picture of Mary and her children
upon it, has become famous over all the world.</p>

<p>Such a round-faced, healthy, happy-looking
baby, held tight in the loving clasp of his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
mother's strong arms! Perhaps he is getting
tired of sitting so long for his picture, and wants
to go down and see what the artist is doing.
His chubby little arms and feet make us think
he is not sitting very still. His lovely mother
bends her head toward him. Her head is
covered with a handkerchief, and there is such
a beautiful shawl around her shoulders. The
older boy looks with love and adoration at his
sweet baby brother, who is looking toward us.
What a beautiful old carved chair they must
have been sitting in!</p>

<p>The mother's face was so good and kind,
and she looked so lovely there on the porch
with her children, that she reminded Raphael
of that other mother, Mary, the mother of the
baby Jesus. The elder brother looked like the
little St. John adoring Jesus. So Raphael
painted a halo around their heads and called
the picture the "Madonna of the Chair."
This halo is a ring of light which artists often
paint around the heads of angels and saints.
Raphael wanted to make us think loving and
tender thoughts about the baby Jesus, Mary,
and St. John.</p>


<p><b>Questions to help the pupil understand the
picture.</b> Who was Bernardo? Where did he
live? What did he do? Why did he not cut
down the oak tree near his house? To whom
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
did he talk? How did the oak tree seem to
answer him? Who was Mary? Tell about the
storm. How long did it last? Who came in
search of Bernardo? Why did he pray that
his two friends might be remembered together?
What became of the oak tree? of Mary?
Who painted her picture? Where was she?
On what did the artist paint the picture? why?
Why is the picture round? How did this make
Bernardo's wish come true? Of whom did
Mary and her children make the artist think?
Why did he paint the halo around their heads?
What is a halo? Why is the picture called
the "Madonna of the Chair"? Of whom did
the artist want to make us think?</p>


<p><b>To the Teacher:</b> Have the children retell
the story of the picture.</p>


<p><b>The story of the artist.</b> Raphael's father
was a painter, and belonged to a family of
painters. Perhaps there never was a more fortunate
little boy born to more loving parents.
And perhaps that, too, is the reason he grew up
with such pleasant ways and such a sweet nature
that every one who knew him loved him. It
made people happy just to be with him.</p>

<p>Raphael's father taught him how to mix
paints, and showed him how to wash and care
for his brushes. He gave him his first lessons
in drawing and painting. Raphael's mother
died when he was only eight years old, but he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
had a stepmother who was very good to him
indeed, and helped him all she could. A few
years later his father died, and so it was through
the help of a generous uncle that he was sent
to the studio of the great artist, Perugino, to
study. The artist-teacher was very fond and
very proud of Raphael, whose work soon became
even better than his own.</p>

<p>Raphael was never jealous or unkind toward
others who did things better than he could do
them. And he made those who could not do
so well as he feel kindly toward him and be
glad of his success. He did all he could to
help poor artists, and was never too busy to see
them. Whenever he went to court to see the
king and queen he was just like a prince in a
fairy story. About fifty of these poorer artists
and friends always went with him to show
everybody how much they loved and admired
him. It was just like a parade.</p>

<p>One day the Pope&mdash;Pope Julius&mdash;sent
for him and told him that he wanted him to
paint some good pictures on the walls of four
of the rooms in his palace, the Vatican. On
these walls pictures had been painted which the
Pope did not like, and he thought Raphael
would know just what to do to make his palace
the most beautiful in the world. Raphael
worked very hard, for he wanted to please the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Pope. Many of the pictures had to be painted
on the ceilings, and he had to lie flat on his back
on a large board placed across two ladders.
You may be sure he grew very tired.</p>

<p>Some days he took long walks in the country.
It was when returning from one of these long
walks that he painted the "Madonna of the
Chair." He painted over forty Madonnas.
This Madonna is seated in a chair, and that is
why it is called the "Madonna of the Chair,"
or "<i>Madonna della Sedia</i>." Most of his paintings
are of stories told in the Bible. He painted
over two hundred eighty-seven pictures. The
artist's last name was Sanzio, but people have
always called him by his first name, Raphael.</p>


<p><b>Questions about the artist.</b> Who painted
this picture? What kind of a boy was he?
Why did people like him? Who taught him to
draw and paint? Who else helped him? What
happened when he went to see the king and
queen? What did the Pope ask him to do?
How did he paint the ceiling? Where did he
like to walk? How did he happen to paint
this picture? What kind of pictures did he
usually paint? How many Madonnas did he
paint? How many pictures all together?</p>

<h2>MISS BOWLES</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Questions to arouse interest.</b> What is the
little girl in this picture doing? Why does she
keep such fast hold of the little dog? Where
do you think they are? Do you think she looks

her hair? How is she dressed? What makes
you think you would like to play with her?
What do you think they have been doing?
Where have they been playing? Do you like
this picture? why?</p>


<p><b>The story of the picture.</b> How pleased little
Miss Bowles must have been when her mamma
and papa told her she was to go to the studio
of the great Sir Joshua Reynolds to have her
picture painted! She must have clapped her
hands, for, as every one knew, Sir Joshua
Reynolds was the most delightful man in the
world. He not only loved children but he
always played with them and kept a great
many wonderful toys in his studio just for them.
Then, too, he had invited her and her mamma
and papa to have lunch with him before she
sat for her picture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
    Sir Joshua had told her mamma to dress
the little girl in the simplest white dress she
had, so she could play, and because he did not
like fine clothes.</p>

<p>It was a lovely drive from her home to the
studio, and the two fine horses held their heads
up and stepped very high as if they, too, were
glad they were going to Sir Joshua's house.
Just as Miss Bowles stepped out of the carriage
the cutest little black and white dog came racing
down the walk to greet her. Little Miss Bowles
was not a bit afraid. How could she be, when
the little black and white dog came right up to
her and stood wagging his tail? When she
had petted him, perhaps he ran to bring a stick
for her to throw, so he could find it and bring
it back to her, just as your dog does. Sir
Joshua heard her laughing and the dog barking
as he came out to welcome them.</p>

<p>Almost at once, luncheon was announced
and they all went in to the big dining room.
Sir Joshua Reynolds sat next to little Miss
Bowles and told her all about the little dog,
whose name, perhaps, was Spot. A lady whose
picture he had painted had given the dog to
him, and she had taught Spot several very
clever tricks which Miss Bowles should see
right after luncheon.</p>

<p>Sir Joshua loved to surprise his little friends.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
When they were not looking he would take their
handkerchiefs from them, or suddenly put some
strange toy in their laps. He loved to see their
look of surprise and delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
    After luncheon came a good romp in the
yard. Perhaps the little dog would bite Miss
Bowles's shoes and try to keep her from running.
How she must have laughed!</p>

<p>When she went back into the house Spot
went in with her. Little Miss Bowles is so
afraid the artist is going to send her pet away
that she holds him fast in her arms, and looks
at Sir Joshua Reynolds as much as to say,
"Now you can't send him away, can you?"
Her eyes fairly sparkle with glee as she squeezes
the little dog much too hard for his comfort.
He knows that she holds him so fast because
she wants to keep him, and he is glad to be with
her, but oh! if she just would not squeeze quite
so hard!</p>

<p>Show me how little Miss Bowles is sitting.
I suppose she is afraid to look away even for a
second for fear Sir Joshua will play some trick
on her and get the little dog away. Sir Joshua
painted so very fast that I don't suppose she
knew just when he drew her picture, although
he probably asked her to sit still when he was
ready to paint. But she must have gone to his
house several times before the picture was
finished. Her father and mother were very
much pleased with the picture, and said it
looked just like their little girl.</p>

<p>Sir Joshua Reynolds loved the woods and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
nature so much that he nearly always painted
them in his pictures. So in the background of
this picture we catch a glimpse of the woods in
the yard where the child and dog have been
playing, and where they have just stopped a
moment to rest.</p>


<p><b>Questions to help the pupil understand the
picture.</b> Where was this picture painted? Why
was little Miss Bowles so glad to go? How did
she go? What came to meet her? What color
was the dog? How did he act? Who gave the
dog to the artist? How did Sir Joshua Reynolds
know little Miss Bowles had come?
How did he tease her? What did they do after
luncheon? Why did she hold the dog so fast?
What can you see behind the little girl?</p>


<p><b>To the Teacher:</b> Let the children illustrate
the story of little Miss Bowles playing with her
dog in the park. Use charcoal, or colored
crayon, on manila paper.</p>


<p><b>The story of the artist.</b> Sir Joshua Reynolds's
father was a teacher in a private school, and
to this school Joshua was sent as soon as he was
old enough to study. Even when a very little
boy Joshua liked to draw. He liked it so well
that it was hard for him to study in school.
He always saw so many things he wanted to
draw that he could not wait until after school,
but drew them on the back of his lesson papers.
One day he drew all over his number paper,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and when he handed it in his father could not
read the numbers on account of the drawing.
His father was disappointed because his son's
paper did not look so neat as the other boys',
and so he wrote at the top of the sheet, "Done
by Joshua out of pure idleness."</p>

<p>Joshua had five brothers and sisters who
liked to draw just as well as he did, and who
could all draw very much better than he could.
It took so much paper and so many pencils for
all his children, that finally the father told them
they might draw on the walls of one of the halls.
The walls had been whitewashed and the children
used burnt sticks for pencils.</p>

<p>At first the older brothers and sisters used
to help little Joshua by guiding his hand, but
he soon learned to draw as well as they. His
first drawings had been so funny that they
laughed at him, but now they praised him
instead. When he was only eight years old he
drew a picture that every one praised very
much. It was a picture of the schoolhouse.
When his father saw it he was so pleased that
he said, "This is wonderful!"</p>

<p>In the little town where Joshua lived the
people had church on Sundays, of course, and
sometimes during the week. One day, Joshua
went to church. At first he sat very still, but
the sermon was a long one, and finally he grew
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
so tired that he could not listen another minute.
He thought he would like to draw a picture of
the minister, but he had nothing to draw it on.
Then he remembered that he had a pencil in
his pocket, and he could draw a picture of the
minister on his thumb nail; and that is just
what he did.</p>

<p>The church was near the river, and after
church Joshua went down to the river bank.
Finding a piece of an old sail, he carried it to a
boathouse. Here, from the picture on his
thumb nail, he drew on the piece of sail the
portrait of the minister. Then he painted it,
using the common paint that is used in painting
boats. Joshua was only eleven years old,
and had finished his first oil painting. His
father had wanted him to be a doctor, but after
seeing this picture he decided to let Joshua
have his own way and be a painter. He sent
him to a good teacher, and lived to see his
son a great artist.</p>


<p><b>Questions about the artist.</b> Who painted
this picture? Where did he go to school?
Who taught him? What did he like to do
best? On what did he draw? Why was his
father disappointed when he saw his number
paper? Where were the children allowed to
draw? With what did they draw? What did
he draw that pleased his father very much?
Tell about the picture of the minister.</p>

<h2>TWO MOTHERS AND THEIR<br />
FAMILIES</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><b>Artist:</b> Elizabeth Gardner Bouguereau <a name="boo" id="boo"></a>(b[=oo]´g&#7869;r&#333;´´).</p>
<p><b>Birthplace:</b> Exeter, New Hampshire.</p>
<p><b>Dates:</b> Born, 1842. Still living, 1918.</p>
</div>


<p><b>Questions to arouse interest.</b> What do
you see in this picture? In what room do you
think they are? Why do you suppose the picture
is called "Two Mothers and Their Families"?
How many little chickens are there?
What time of the year do you think it is?
time of day? What is the little boy doing?
How many of you like this picture? why?</p>


<p><b>The story of the picture.</b> This little boy is
having a good time feeding the fluffy little
chickens. He has scattered some grain on the
floor and the old hen and eight of her chicks are
eating as fast as they can.</p>

<p>Two of the old hen's chicks must have wandered
away, so that at first they did not hear
the mother hen's cluck. Now see how they
flutter their wings as they hurry back toward
the others!</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="p043a-illus" id="p043a-illus"></a>
<img src="images/p043a-illus.jpg" width="500" height="687" alt="Moms and babies" title=""/>
<p class="caption2"> <i>Two Mothers and Their Families</i></p>
</div>

<p>The old mother hen takes such good care
of her little chickens! When it is very cold
she will spread out her wings until all the little
ones are covered. She keeps them warm and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
snug. If it rains, and she cannot get them
under shelter, she will protect them with her
wings in the pouring rain, much as she dislikes
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
it. Every day she must scratch for bugs and
worms for them and teach them how to scratch
for their own living.</p>

<p>She watches carefully to see that nothing
harms them. Sometimes big birds, called
chicken hawks, fly over the yard ready to
swoop down and carry little chickens away in
their claws. Then there are other things to be
feared, such as weasels and rats; even cats and
dogs might harm her little ones. Is it any
wonder the mother hen is anxious, and apt to
be cross when we go near her little chicks? It
is best to be careful, then, for if she thinks you
mean to hurt them she will fly at you and hurt
you with her sharp bill.</p>

<p>When the artist, Mrs. Elizabeth Gardner
Bouguereau, visited this home and saw the
mother and her child watching this old hen and
her chickens, it is no wonder she wanted to
paint them. She wanted to make us feel the
love of the mother hen for her little ones as
well as that of the other mother for her children.</p>

<p>The child is delighted, as, safe in his mother's
arms, he looks around to see if she is watching,
too. There is a little baby sister in the cradle,
and that is the reason he keeps very quiet and
does not speak. No doubt the mother has
rocked the baby to sleep. You can see how the
baby is fastened in the cradle so she cannot fall
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
out. That odd-looking top over part of the
cradle is placed there to keep the light from
the baby's eyes. Just now it is moved a little
to one side, and we can see part of the baby's
face.</p>

<p>This home probably belongs to a French
peasant who goes to his work very early in the
morning, or he would be with his family now.</p>

<p>It must be a very hot day in summer, for
both mother and child are barefooted and they
are dressed for warm weather.</p>

<p>See the pots and pans hanging on the wall
under the shelf, and the old kettle hanging
over the large open fireplace! The room must
be kitchen, bedroom, and dining room all in
one; perhaps they have only this one room.
There is a basket on the stand, and most likely
it is filled with vegetables brought in from the
garden for dinner.</p>

<p>What a happy, healthy little boy this is, with
his hair in little ringlets all over his head! His
half-closed hand makes us think he still has
some corn left to scatter on the floor for the
chickens.</p>

<p>It seems very strange to see chickens running
about in the house. If the mother and child
were not dressed so as to keep themselves cool
we should think they had let them in because
it was too cold for them outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
    The mother looks as proud of her small son
as the mother hen is of her young family.
What a pleasant face she has! The old hen
does not feel anxious when she is near, for she
knows this other mother is kind and will care
for her and her fluffy little chicks. The boy,
too, seems to be very careful, and the hen is
glad to have the grain scattered by his kind
little hand.</p>

<p>There is so much bright light in the picture
that we are sure there is an open door near by,
though we cannot see it in the picture. It was
through this open doorway that the mother hen
and her chicks strayed into the house. Probably
the artist sat in the doorway as she painted.</p>


<p><b>Questions to help the pupil understand the
picture.</b> What is the little boy doing? What
makes you think he has just scattered corn for
the chickens? How many chickens have found
the grain? What are the other two chickens
doing? How does the mother hen care for
her chickens? What do you see standing
beside the mother and child? Who is sleeping
in the cradle? What are the straps for?
the shade? Why do you think it must have
been a hot day? What hangs under the shelf?
What do you see on the shelf? What is on
the stand? Why is the old hen not afraid of
the mother and child? In what way are the
two mothers alike? From which direction does
the light seem to come?</p>

    <b>The story of the artist.</b> We know very little
about the artist, Mrs. Elizabeth Gardner Bouguereau,
except that she is an American who
has spent most of her life in France. She
studied in Paris for many years and was a pupil
of the great artist Bouguereau, whom she
married. Her pictures have been exhibited
many times in this country and abroad. Among
her best-known works, besides the "Two
Mothers and Their Families," are "Cinderella,"
"Fortune Teller," "Maud Muller," "Cornelia
and Her Jewels," and "Corinne." She has
also painted a number of portraits. Many
of her pictures are of children. She is still
living in Paris, France.</p>

<h2>CAN'T YOU TALK?</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><b>Artist:</b> G. A. Holmes (h&#333;mz).</p>
<p><b>Birthplace:</b> England.</p>
<p><b>Dates:</b> Unknown.</p>
</div>


<p><b>Questions to arouse interest.</b> What do
you see in this picture? Where are they?
Why is the stone floor not too cold for the baby?
What time of day do you think it is? why?
What do you suppose the baby has been doing?
What makes you think the big dog loves the
baby? What is the little kitten doing? What
do you see on the stone bench? Do you like
the picture? why?</p>


<p><b>The story of the picture.</b> It must have been
a warm summer day when this little baby
slipped out of her bed, crept across the room
to the door, and out on the cool stone porch.</p>

<p>It may have been a Monday morning, when
the baby's mamma was very busy in the kitchen,
washing the clothes. Probably she put the
baby to bed for the usual morning nap, and did
not hear her wake up.</p>

<p>It must be about noon, for the shadows are
short in the picture. The mother is probably
out in the yard, taking her clean clothes off the
line, so of course she could not hear the baby
creep out through the open door to the porch.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
There the baby found the great dog keeping
watch. How wise he looks! He knows the
baby's mamma would be worried if she knew
what her little one is doing, and his kind eyes
seem to say, "Never mind, I'll take care of
her."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="p049a-illus" id="p049a-illus"></a>
<img src="images/p049a-illus.jpg" width="500" height="372" alt="Baby meets the animals" title=""/>
<p class="caption2"> "Can't You Talk?"</p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the baby asks him, "Where's my
mamma?" He looks as if he wanted to answer
or say something, and she cannot understand
why he does not, so she crawls up to him and
says, "Can't you talk?" But the big dog can
only wag his tail and watch the baby. If she
should crawl too far away, we feel sure he would
try to persuade her to come back, or if he could
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
not do that, he would bark and let the mother
know something was wrong.</p>

<p>What chubby little hands and feet the baby
has! You can almost see the dimples in her
cheeks. She is a friendly, happy little child,
I'm sure, and you can see that her pets love
her. There is the little kitten rubbing up
against the door as if waiting to see if the dog
will answer baby's question. Kitty seems to
be afraid to come out on the porch, although
the dog does not look as if he would hurt her.
Sometimes little babies with such chubby
hands squeeze their pets too hard, and maybe
this little kitten, although she loves the baby,
does not want to come too near.</p>

<p>There is a stone bench at one side of the
porch. It looks as if some one had left a market
basket, a cabbage, and a bag on it. Perhaps
in the basket are potatoes from the garden.</p>

<p>What a busy life this baby has with so many
things to do and so much to learn! She tries
so hard to understand. I suppose she thinks,
"Good old dog, you seem to know so much more
than I do. How does it happen that I can talk
and you cannot?"</p>

<p>The mother will be coming in soon, and
how surprised she will be to find her baby up
and out on the porch, with the big dog taking
such good care of her!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
    This good old dog does so much to help
them! All night long he guards the house, not
allowing any one even to stop on the walk in
front of the house, without his warning bark.
In the daytime, if the people wish to go away,
they may be sure the faithful dog will allow no
one to enter the house while they are gone.
No harm can come to these good people while
he is there to help them. You can tell by
looking at him that he is well fed and well
cared for. That fluffy little kitten, too, just
ready to dart back into the house and scamper
across the floor, looks happy and contented.
Evidently the people who live in this house
with its wide stone porch are good and kind.
Should you not like to visit them?</p>


<p><b>Questions to help the pupil understand the
picture.</b> How did the baby get out on the
porch? Why does she not walk? Where has
she been? What time of day is it? Where
do you suppose her mother is? What did the
baby find on the porch? What does she ask
the dog? How can he answer? How does he
take care of her? What makes you think her
pets love her? Why does the little kitten stay
inside? What is on the stone bench? Should
you like to visit the people who live in this
house? why?</p>


<p><b>To the Teacher:</b> Encourage the children
to talk about their pets at home, and to draw
pictures of them.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
    <b>The story of the artist.</b> Although Mr.
Holmes has painted many very popular pictures
of children and their pets, we can find very little
information about his life except that he was
an Englishman. However, he cannot be forgotten
so long as his pictures live to tell us
of his little friends and their faithful pets.</p>


<p><b>Questions about the artist.</b> Who painted
this picture? What do his pictures tell us about
the artist? In what country was he born?</p>


<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS</h2>

<p><b>Studying the picture.</b> Several days before the lesson is to
be taken up, the picture to be studied should be placed where
every pupil can see it.</p>

<p>First of all, the children should find out for themselves
what is in the picture. The questions accompanying the
story of each picture are intended to help them to do this.</p>


<p><b>Language work.</b> The pupils should be encouraged in class
to talk freely and naturally. In this way the lesson becomes
a language exercise in which the pupils will gain in freedom
of expression and in the ability to form clear mental images.</p>

<p>If a lesson does not occupy the entire drawing period, the
children should be asked to retell the story of the picture.</p>


<p><b>Dramatization and drawing.</b> Most of the stories told by the
pictures lend themselves readily to dramatization and, whenever
practicable, such stories should be acted out. The stories
also offer numerous interesting situations that may be used
as subjects for drawing lessons.</p>


<p><b>The review lesson.</b> The review lesson should cover all pictures
and artists studied throughout the year. At this time
other pictures available by the same artists should be on
exhibition.</p>

<p>The review work may be conducted as a contest in which
the pictures are held up, one at a time, while the class writes
the name of the picture and the artist on slips of paper which
have been prepared and numbered for that purpose. One
teacher who used this device surprised her class by presenting
those whose lists were correct with their choice of any of the
large-sized Perry pictures studied.</p>

<p>Many teachers, however, will prefer to use this time for
composition work, although the description of pictures is often
given as an English lesson. Pupils may write a description of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
their favorite picture. In fact, the lessons can be made to
correlate with history, geography, English, spelling, reading, or
nature study.</p>

<p>In any event the real purpose of the work is that the pupils
shall become so familiar with the pictures that they will recognize
them as old friends whenever and wherever they may see
them.</p>

<p>It is hoped that acquaintance with the picture and the
interest awakened by its story will grow into a fuller appreciation
and understanding of the artist's work. Thus the children
will have many happy hours and will learn to love the good,
the true, and the beautiful in everything about them.</p>
